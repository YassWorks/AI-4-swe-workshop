# AI for Software Engineering Workshop

This repository contains mini projects for the "AI for software engineering" workshop scheduled for the 2025 IEEE CS Summer School event. Each project demonstrates clever ways to use AI to learn and grow effectively as a software engineer without spoiling the learning experience.

## Mini Projects

### 1. **Error Insight Generator** (`get_help_C/`)
Get immediate AI insights on C compilation errors with detailed explanations and suggestions.

### 2. **Unit Test Generator** (`generate_unit_tests/`)  
Automatically generate comprehensive unit tests for existing JavaScript code using AI.

## Setup

Each project has its own requirements and setup instructions. See individual project READMEs for details.

## Inference Provider

All projects use **Cerebras** as the inference provider, offering a generous free tier with access to powerful models like **Qwen 3**.
